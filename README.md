# Cryptocurrency price tracker

## Description

Cryptocurrency Price Tracker is a web application that allows users to track the prices of various cryptocurrencies. By selecting a base currency, such as USD, and choosing a cryptocurrency, the application provides users with essential information, including the current price, the change in the last 24 hours, the highest price of the day, and the lowest price of the day.

## Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS (following the mobile-first approach and BEM methodology)

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply the theory learned about Fetch API with async/await in a real-world application. By building the Cryptocurrency Price Tracker, I aim to enhance my practical understanding of API integration, data retrieval, and displaying dynamic information on a web page.

## Features

- Currency selection: Users can choose their preferred base currency (e.g., USD) for price comparison.
- Cryptocurrency selection: Users can select from a wide range of cryptocurrencies to track their prices.
- Real-time data: The application fetches up-to-date data from reliable sources to ensure accurate and timely information.
- Price variation tracking: Users can see the change in cryptocurrency prices over the last 24 hours.
- Daily price extremes: The application provides users with the highest and lowest prices recorded for the selected cryptocurrency during the day.
